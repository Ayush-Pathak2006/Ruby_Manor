## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ruby-manor.git](https://github.com/your-username/ruby-manor.git)
    cd ruby-manor
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Supabase:**
    * Create a project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com/).
    * Use the SQL scripts provided in the project (or run the `CREATE TABLE` and `ALTER TABLE` commands from our chat) to set up the `rooms`, `dining`, `menu_items`, `bookings`, `reservations`, `waitlist_queue`, `profiles`, and `feedback` tables.
    * Enable Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables and apply the necessary policies (refer to our chat history for the SQL commands).
    * Upload images to Supabase Storage and update the `image_url` fields in your `rooms` and `dining` tables.
    * Configure Google OAuth provider in Supabase Authentication settings and get your Client ID/Secret from Google Cloud Console.
    * Update Authorized Redirect URIs in Google Cloud Console with your Supabase callback URL and your local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
    * Update the Site URL in Supabase Auth settings to your local development URL initially.

4.  **Set up Brevo:**
    * Create an account on [Brevo](https://brevo.com).
    * Verify your sender email address (e.g., `no-reply@yourdomain.com`).
    * Get your Brevo API Key (v3).

5.  **Environment Variables:**
    * Create a `.env` file in the root directory. **Do not commit this file!**
    * Add your Supabase public keys:
        ```env
        VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL"
        VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_ANON_KEY"
        ```

6.  **Set up Supabase CLI & Edge Function:**
    * Install the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) using a supported method (Scoop, Homebrew, etc.).
    * Log in: `supabase login`
    * Link the project: `supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF`
    * Set the Brevo API key secret: `supabase secrets set BREVO_API_KEY=YOUR_BREVO_API_KEY`
    * Deploy the email function: `supabase functions deploy send-confirmation-email --no-verify-jwt`

7.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or the port specified) in your browser.

## üîë Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required to run the application:

* `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL.
* `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase public anonymous key.

For deployment (e.g., on Netlify), these variables must be set in the build environment settings. The `BREVO_API_KEY` must be set as a secret using the Supabase CLI (`supabase secrets set ...`).
